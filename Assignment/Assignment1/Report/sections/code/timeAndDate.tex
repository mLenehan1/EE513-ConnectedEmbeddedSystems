The provided code contains all of the functionality required to connect to the
RTC, read and display the current time. These features were initially extracted
into methods in order to make the code more modular. To read the time and date,
the I2C bus connection must be opened, the device address must be connected to,
the read address must be specified, and the values must be read into a buffer.
The desired values can then be displayed from the buffer.

In the case of the Raspberry Pi, the RTC is on I2C bus 1. As such, the code for
opening this connection is as follows:
