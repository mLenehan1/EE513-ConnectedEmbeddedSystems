To read the time and date, the I2C bus connection must be opened, the device
address must be connected to, the read address must be specified, and the values
must be read into a buffer.
This functionality was implemented within the ``I2CDevice'' class. The
``setupProc'' method calls the ``openBus'', ``connectDevice'', ``resetReadAddr''
and ``readBuffer'' methods each time an object of the I2CDevice class is
created, opening the connection to the device.

From the read buffer, the desired values can be displayed. This functionality is
implemented using the ``DS3231'' class ``readTimeAndDate'' method:

This method reads from the registers indexed by values `2', `1', and `0', which
are the hours, minutes, and seconds registers respectively, printing their
values in decimal form. As the values read from these registers are in binary
coded decimal format, the provided ``bcdToDec'' function is used to convert
them. The date values are read from registers `4', `5', and `6', which are the
day, month and year registers respectively. These values are also stored in BCD
format, and so the ``bcdToDec'' function must be used for the purpose of
printing.
