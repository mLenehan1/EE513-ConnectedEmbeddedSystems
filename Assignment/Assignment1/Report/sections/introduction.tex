This assignment aims to introduce students to integrating physical sensors or
devices with an embedded Linux platform. In this case the physical device being
used is the DS3231 Real Time Clock module, and the embedded Linux platform is a
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. The devices can communicate via the I2C protocol.

The requirements of the assignment state that a C++ class must be implemented
for this integration. This class must contain all methods required for the reading
and writing of the RTC time, date, alarm, control, and temperature registers.
The student must also implement a ``novel function'' of their choosing.

In completing this assignment, the student should have a greater understanding
of the object oriented code required for I2C communications, and the code
required to read or write data to/from a physical devices registers.
