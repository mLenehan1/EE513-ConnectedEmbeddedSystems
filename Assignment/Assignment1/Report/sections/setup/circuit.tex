The following components are used for this assignment:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
	\item Samsung SD Card
	\item Maxim Integrated DS3231 Real Time Clock Breakout Board.
\end{enumerate}

The I2C protocol is used for communications between the RTC and the Raspberry
Pi. As such, the RTC must be connected to the Raspberry Pi via the I2C data and
clock connections, on pins 3 and 5 (GPIO 2 and 3) respectively. The RTC breakout
board operates on a 3.3V supply voltage, and as such the 3.3V (pin 1), and
ground (pin 6) pins must also be connected.

Connecting these pins results in the following layout:
