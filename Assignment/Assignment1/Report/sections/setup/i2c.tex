In order to setup I2C on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, the I2C bus must first be
enabled. This is achieved by executing the command ``raspi-config''. Navigating
to the ``Interfacing Options'' tab, and selecting ``I2C'' to enable the bus.

Once the circuit is connected, the i2ctools package must be installed in order
to verify the connection. The package can be installed by executing the
following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	sudo apt install i2c-tools
\end{lstlisting}

Once installed the I2C bus can be scanned using the ``i2cdetect command''. The
``-l'' option lists the installed busses.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	i2cdetect -l
\end{lstlisting}

The output of this command corresponds to the I2C bus that the device is
connected to. Using the ``-r'' option, bus 1 can be scanned using
the SMBus ``receive byte'' method. The ``-y'' option in this case disables user
input for confirmation.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	i2cdetect -y -r 1
\end{lstlisting}

Finally the ``i2cdump'' command can be used to dump the contents of the
specified address, in this case ``0x68'' on bus 1:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	i2cdump -y 1 0x68
\end{lstlisting}
